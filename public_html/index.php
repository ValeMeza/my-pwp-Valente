That guy is the Red Grin Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. Slow down! Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.

                its fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities morty, and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. high chair, no no no recliner... and wheelchair on half. I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die!

            <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">
                I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come. Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. I'm the Devil, what should I do when I fail? Give myself an ice cream?

                Aw, geez. Puh rum pum pow! Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. The fucking amish bitch shot me!</div>
