            <p>Welcome, my name is Valente Meza I am an up and coming Front End Web Developer eager to share my work, invite more opportunist's, continue to learn and contribute to the tech industry!
            About Me: As a junior developer I have concentrated my career focusing on back end coding; reading the documentation for PHP, practicing with mySQL, Object Oriented, working with Angler2 etc... I enjoy team work, take direction well while maintaining a voice on the project. I enjoy a challenge and welcome new skill sets. I am a jack of all trades, master of none, but better then a master of one.
                Portfolio: Here is example of my latest work...
