            <h2>Example Employer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: June Warwick</li>
                <li>Age: 34</li>
                <li>Profession: June Warwick is the head of a recent Web Devolpment startup looking to take contracts from everywhere, government, local business does'nt matter! She has a team of intermediate programmers that are working on 3 to 4 projects at a time while taking care of any tickets and bugs that come there way.</li>
                <li>Technology: Employees bring there own computers; windows 10 and Mac's with the company having their own web hosting servers. June herself uses a Mac pro Desktop and a Macbook pro laptop on the go. </li>
                <li>Attitudes and Behaviors: June spends most of her time maintaining the company contracts, company image, and coding as well as most HR work. On her free time she still spends all her time on her laptop where she is a huge networking fiend. Twitter is her best friend,where she posts most of her local contributions and when she attends local developer workshops, linkin to help contract more work. With such a competitive nature with contracts she knows its only a matter of time till until she decides to expand.</li>
                <li>Frustrations and Needs: June is looking to hire a junior Web Developer to do bug testing and other small task to allow the other developers to shift focus on other projects to meet deadlines for other projects. She is trying her best to diversify while getting the best possible candidate unfortunately most junior programmers have been more work then they claim to be.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Goals: Junes' main goal at this point is to hire someone that does'nt need hand holding and can learn to keep up with the pace. She would prefer to diversify to hopefully bring in more intuitive ideas, but still needs someone with basic understanding of HTML, Java, PHP,CSS, and mySQL</p>
            <h2>Use Case:</h2>
            <p>After a long day of bug fixes. She spends the afternoon posting retweets and plans to attend a code for abq get together. While she does a bit of networking, we meet and I give her my URL to my website. After checking my website and checking my gitHub and linkid she decides to give me an opportunity to to fix bugs. After a month of learning there system im able to keep up with there normal day to day projects and move from junior to intermediate programmer.</p>
